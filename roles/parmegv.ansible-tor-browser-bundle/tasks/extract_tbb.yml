# The unarchive module is relying on tar's --diff option, which does not check
# file hashes, just that the same filenames are present. Thus you can change a
# file inside the unarchived folder, while preserving it's name, and tar --diff
# will consider it unchanged. tar's --skip-old-files behaves in the same way.
# When we re-run our playbook it's necessary we ensure the same end-state and
# overwrite a potentially polluted browser profile. Hence the following:

- name: Remove the dir the TBB tarball will be extracted to.
  file:
    path: "{{ tbb_path }}"
    state: absent

- name: Extract TBB archive.
  unarchive:
    copy: no
    src: "{{ tbb_dirpath }}/{{ tbb_filename }}"
    dest: "{{ tbb_dirpath }}"
